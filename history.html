          International History
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lambda Chi Alpha International Fraternity is one of the largest menâ€™s
          general fraternities in North America. Founded in 1909 at Boston
          University, it has more than 227,000 initiated members and has held
          subsidiaries (called chapters) at more than 300 universities. Designed
          to prepare its members to be leaders for the world in which they will
          live, Lambda Chi Alpha has a mission to inspire the highest level of
          character, values, scholarship, and service in each of its members. It
          was the first fraternity to eliminate pledging and remains a leader in
          the fight against hazing, alcohol abuse, and other challenges facing
          today's college student. Lambda Chi Alpha serves to complement higher
          education by providing opportunities for academic achievement,
          leadership development, and lifelong friendships.

        <h2>
          Chapter History
        </h2>
        <p>
          Our chapter also has an intricate history.  We started in the late
          19th century as the secret society PIES.  Then we were incorporated
          into the fraternity Theta Kappa Nu.  Through the great depression, our
          fraternity fell upon hard times due to reduced growth and overall
          membership.  One of our chapter's alumni suggested that Theta Kappa Nu
          at large merges with Lambda Chi Alpha.  When the merge succeeded, we
          were awarded the Theta-Kappa denomination.  Since then we have
          relocated to an on campus house, next to the Triangle house.  We take
          great pride in our house and our brotherhood.  This drives our alumni
          to come back and improve the house each year along with our active
          brothers.
