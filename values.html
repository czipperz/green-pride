        <p>
          We believe that the only path to attainment is through hard work.
          Thus the brothers of Lambda Chi Alpha devote themselves to improving
          themselves, the brotherhood, and the community in which we reside.  We
          truly believe in giving back to our community.  We volunteer for Meals
          on Wheels, the American Legion, and Catholic Charities on a weekly
          basis.  Every year we host a Christmas party for underprivileged
          children in Terre Haute, providing them with gifts, food, and
          entertainment.  We also participate in the North American food drive
          and host a variety of other philanthropic events.  We have raised over
          2000 pounds of food for Feeding America this year.  We believe in
          bettering ourselves and our community through our service.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Vir Quisque Vir &mdash; Every Man a Man
        </h3>
        <p>
          Lambda Chi Alpha did away with the archaic pledge system and
          instituted the Associate Member program.  Lambda Chi wanted to get
          away from the "pledge class."  You do not join the Fraternity to just
          be with the other Associate Members.  That is why we fully integrated
          the Associate Members with the Brothers.  Brotherhood is learned
          through personal experience, one on one.  The Associate Membership
          program is an orientation to fraternity life within Lambda Chi Alpha.
        </p>

        <h2>
          LDRSHIP
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lambda Chi's seven core values fit into the acronym LDRSHIP.  They
          stand for Loyalty, Duty, Respect, Service and Stewardship, Honor,
          Integrity, and Personal Courage.  We will help you by providing the
          experience and training to cultivate these attributes.  As a member of
          Lambda Chi Alpha, there are many leadership opportunities available.
          In addition, we promote your involvement in our many service
          opportunities as well as on campus activities.
