          Lambda Chi Alpha International Fraternity
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lambda Chi Alpha International Fraternity is one of the largest menâ€™s general fraternities in North America. Founded in 1909 at Boston University, it has more than 227,000 initiated members and has held subsidiaries (called chapters) at more than 300 universities. Designed to prepare its members to be leaders for the world in which they will live, Lambda Chi Alpha has a mission to inspire the highest level of character, values, scholarship, and service in each of its members. It was the first fraternity to eliminate pledging and remains a leader in the fight against hazing, alcohol abuse, and other challenges facing today's college student. Lambda Chi Alpha serves to complement higher education by providing opportunities for academic achievement, leadership development, and lifelong friendships.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Don't Pledge Us, Join Us!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Lambda Chi Alpha did away with the archaic pledge system and instituted the Associate Member program. Lambda Chi wanted to get away from the "pledge class." You do not join the Fraternity to just be with the other Associate Members. That is why we fully integrated the Associate Members with the Brothers. Brotherhood is learned through personal experience, one on one. The Associate Membership program is an orientation to fraternity life within Lambda Chi Alpha.
